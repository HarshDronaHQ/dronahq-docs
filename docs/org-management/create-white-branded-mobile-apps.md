## Creating Keystore (.jks) file

Java Key Store (JKS) file is required to sign your Android Application (Apk / Bundle). If you already have a Keystore file generated or you want DronaHQ to create one, you can skip this step. This steps involves creating a private key from your computer.
We will be using `Java Keytool utility` that comes with any standard JDK distribution and can be located at `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`

 From a `command prompt`, we can type the following to get a JKS.

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.jks -storetype JKS -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Where you need to provide the following details:
1. Keystore password â youâll need this to unlock this Keystore again in the future. If you lose this password, it is pretty much impossible to recover it.
1. Re-enter Keystore password.
1. Your First Name and Last Name.
1. Name of the Organization Unit.
1. Name of the Organization.
1. Name of the City or Locality.
1. Name of the State or Province.
1. Two letter Country Code.
1. Confirmation of above details, enter `yes`.
1. Key password (It can be same as Keystore password).

Here, 
- 10000 is the number of days this keystore will be valid for.
- my-release-key.jks is the name of the keystore file that will be generated.
- alias_name is the Alias name for your keystore. you can give any friendly name of your choice instead.
