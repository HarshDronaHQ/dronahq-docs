# Sentry Logger Integration

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to integrate Sentry Logger as an external logger within the DronaHQ platform.

## Introduction

Sentry Logger integration allows you to capture and manage logs efficiently in your DronaHQ modules. Follow the steps below to set up Sentry Logger as your external logger.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A DronaHQ account with an Enterprise Plan.
- Access to a Sentry account.
- Sentry connection details.

## Configuration Steps

To get started with Sentry Logger integration, follow these steps:

1. Create a new project or select an existing one to send your logs to.

2. Obtain the Sentry DSN (Data Source Name). You will need this DSN to configure the integration.
