## Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) 

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are a game-changer in the world of public applications. They offer a modern approach to delivering an engaging user experience without the need for users to install and manage traditional apps. PWAs are websites that act like native mobile applications, providing fast performance, offline access, and seamless interactions.
