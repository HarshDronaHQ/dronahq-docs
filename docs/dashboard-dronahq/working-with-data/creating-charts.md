## Using Chart Builder

Familiarize yourself with the Chart Builder page to configure a chart and run a query. Verify your chart source before creating any chart. Editing a pre-saved dataset directly from the Chart Builder will affect all charts using the same dataset.

1. Metrics & Columns Panel:
   - Below the Chart Source panel, use the Metrics and Columns panel to quickly find the necessary data.
   - Icons indicate data types:
     - Æ’: Function used for metrics
     - Clock: Time column
     - abc: Text data
     - #: Numeric value data
   - Drag and drop Metrics and Columns into the Query panel to configure your visualization.

2. Chart Type Panel:
   - Use the Chart Type panel to change your visualization type.
   - DronaHQ recommends using charts with the `Recommended` tag.
   - Switch between common chart types without losing already configured fields.

3. Configuring Fields:
   - Viewing Data Samples: Click `Samples` above the "Run a query to display results" section to pull raw data in table form.
   - Choosing the Dimension for the X-axis: Specify the x-axis dimension in the "Query" panel. Support for temporal (time series) and non-temporal x-axis dimensions is available. For temporal datasets, define the granularity of displayed x-axis values.
   - Add a Metric or Column: Drag a metric or column to the applicable destination fields. A pop-out window will appear for details.
