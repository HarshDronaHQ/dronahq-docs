Begin your chart creation with a physical or virtual dataset to scale chart building and reuse predefined metrics. Let's see how to start with creating your chart on any dataset available.

## Creating a Chart

### From Chart Builder
First of. navigate to the `Charts` section on dashboard and click the `+ Chart` icon. On the "Create a new chart" screen, click the drop-down arrow in the "Choose a Dataset" field and select a dataset.

Now simply choose a chart type and click `Create new chart`. It is recommended to use charts with the `Recommended` tag in the chart gallery. You can select the desired chart from the "Create a new chart" dialogue and change the chart type in the Data tab of the Chart Builder.

 ### From SQL Lab - Initiating with a SQL Query

You can begin your chart creation by writing a SQL query, which allows for flexible, ad-hoc data exploration and the definition of new metrics. Here's the process for creating a chart from a SQL query:

Select the appropriate data source from the left-hand side. Enter your SQL query in the provided text box.
- - Click `Run` to execute the query and reveal the `Create Chart` button.
- Once the query runs successfully, click `Create Chart` to proceed.

## Using Chart Builder

Familiarize yourself with the Chart Builder page to configure a chart and run a query. Verify your chart source before creating any chart. Editing a pre-saved dataset directly from the Chart Builder will affect all charts using the same dataset.

1. Metrics & Columns Panel:
   - Below the Chart Source panel, use the Metrics and Columns panel to quickly find the necessary data.
   - Icons indicate data types:
     - Æ’: Function used for metrics
     - Clock: Time column
     - abc: Text data
     - #: Numeric value data
   - Drag and drop Metrics and Columns into the Query panel to configure your visualization.

2. Chart Type Panel:
   - Use the Chart Type panel to change your visualization type.
   - DronaHQ recommends using charts with the `Recommended` tag.
   - Switch between common chart types without losing already configured fields.

3. Configuring Fields:
   - Viewing Data Samples: Click `Samples` above the "Run a query to display results" section to pull raw data in table form.
   - Choosing the Dimension for the X-axis: Specify the x-axis dimension in the "Query" panel. Support for temporal (time series) and non-temporal x-axis dimensions is available. For temporal datasets, define the granularity of displayed x-axis values.
   - Add a Metric or Column: Drag a metric or column to the applicable destination fields. A pop-out window will appear for details. 

4. Create Chart:
   once everything is set, click on `Create Chart` it, will run the query and will provide a chart with required details. Most DronaHQ charts are interactive; hover over parts of the chart to see additional details.

6. Further Customizations:
   - To customize, select the `Customize` tab to see available options for the selected chart type.
   - Experiment with different chart types and configuration settings to express your data in various ways. Update time ranges or add filters to access more or less data.

## Saving and Sharing the Chart

At the top right of Chart Builder, select `Save`. In the Save chart dialogue, you can create a new dashboard and add the chart to it. 

For sharing and other options, next to Save, click the meatballs icon for chart tools. you will find that to share a chart there are options like, share the chart by 
   - Copy the chart permalink.
   - Share chart by email.
   - Share by embed.
