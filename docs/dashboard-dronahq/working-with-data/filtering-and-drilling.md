DronaHQ's Dashboard Filters provide a way to manage data filtering. From any dashboard, you can expand the Filters
sidebar to effortlessly apply multiple filters across all charts within that dashboard.

The "Value" filters allow you to specify values for any column in your dataset, offering great flexibility with various
filter options. "Numerical range" filters let you easily define a range for numeric values, such as pricing or years.
Additionally, Dashboard includes several time-based filters—Time Range, Time Column, and Time Grain—that enable you to
filter all charts according to the time column in your dataset.

With both basic and advanced configuration settings, you can enhance your filter options and improve usability.

## Different Filter Types

In the Add and edit filters window, under the `Settings` tab, there are several sections. The first section consists of
four essential fields:

1. Filter Type: Choose a filter type from the available options, which include Value, Numerical Range, Time Range, Time
   Column, and Time Grain (detailed descriptions provided below).

2. Filter Name: Provide a brief, descriptive name for the new filter. This name usually reflects the choice made in the
   following Column field.

3. Dataset: Select the dataset that will be used for the charts within the dashboard. By default, all datasets linked to
   the dashboard's charts are available for selection. This option appears when the Value, Numerical Range, Time Column,
   or Time Grain filter types are chosen.

4. Column: Choose the column to which the filter will apply. This option is available when either the Value or Numerical
   Range filter types are selected.

Now, let's focus into the four filter types available in the `Filter Type` field.

### Value Type

This filter type generates a drop-down menu that displays all available values from the selected column (as specified in
the Column field).

For example, if you select the Value filter type and then choose the "Department" column, a drop-down filter menu
labeled "Department" will appear on the dashboard. This menu allows you to filter the data displayed in all charts by
the selected department. When the filter is applied, only the data relevant to the chosen department will be visible
across all charts in the dashboard.

</figure>

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/dhq-dashboard/working-with-data/filter-drill/value-type-val.jpeg" alt="Filter Type - value" />
</figure>

In this case, if you select a specific department, the dashboard will update to show data only for that department after
you apply the filter.

### Numerical Range

This filter type generates a range slider that allows you to define a start and end point based on the numerical values
in the selected column.

For example, if you choose the "Numerical range" filter type and then select the "Electricity_Usage" column, a range
slider will appear. This slider enables you to set a specific range of electricity usage. Once applied, all charts
within the dashboard will display data corresponding only to the selected electricity usage range.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/dhq-dashboard/working-with-data/filter-drill/num-range-val.jpeg" alt="Filter Type - Numerical Range" />
</figure>

In this case, if you adjust the slider to a particular range, the dashboard will update to show data only within that
range after applying the filter.

### Time Range

This filter type generates a button that, when clicked, opens the Edit Time Range functionality. This feature is the
same as the Time Range option used when creating a new chart.

</figure>

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/dhq-dashboard/working-with-data/filter-drill/time-range-val.jpeg" alt="Filter Type - time Range" />
</figure>

### Time Column

This filter type generates a drop-down menu that allows you to select a new dashboard-level time column, which will
override any existing time columns defined at the chart level.

:::tip

When should you use this filter type? The Time Column filter is ideal when your dataset contains multiple time columns.
If your dataset only has one time column (which is automatically selected), this filter type may not be necessary.

### Time Grain

This filter type creates a drop-down that enables you to select a time granularity. When applied, all timestamps are
grouped based on the selected time grain.

</figure>

:::info NOTE

In the `Scoping` tab, there are two radio options, to determine the scope of the filter we are creating. User can select
between:

1. Apply to all panels - This will make sure that all panels with this column will be affected by this filter.
2. Apply to specific panels - With this option only selected panels will be affected by this filter.

:::

## Parent - Child Filter

By using the `Values are dependent on other filters` configuration option we can apply a parent-child type relationship
between filters. This configuration turns an existing filter into a sub-filter of a parent.

| Feature                       | Value | Numerical Range | Time Range | Time Column | Time Grain |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Parent-child                  | ✔     |                 |            |             |            |
| Pre - Filter available values | ✔     | ✔               |            |             |            |
| Sort filter values            | ✔     |                 | ✔          | ✔           | ✔          |
| Single value                  |       | ✔               |            |             |            |

### Values are dependent on other filters

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/dhq-dashboard/working-with-data/filter-drill/parent-child.jpeg" alt=" Values are dependednt on other filters - Configuration" />
  <figcaption align="center"><i> Values are dependednt on other filters - Configuration</i></figcaption>
</figure>

let's have a closer look at how the configuration option works. This option is used to turn a filter into a sub-filter
of an existing filter. In this example, we will make the `building_Type` filter a sub-filter of the `department_type`
filter (i.e., the `department type` filter becomes the parent).

The idea is to allow users to first select a department, and then refine their selection further by choosing a building
type within the selected department.

To start, select the `building_Type` filter and, in the Filter Configuration panel, check the
`Values Are Dependent On Other Filters` option.

After doing this, a `Values Dependent On` drop-down menu appears — now go ahead and select `department_type` as the
parent filter and then click `Save`.

## Pre - Filter Data

What if you want to limit the available values in a filter based on specific criteria before users interact with it?
That's where the `Pre - Filter Available Values` option comes in.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/dhq-dashboard/working-with-data/filter-drill/pre-filter.jpeg" alt=" Pre - Filter available values - Configuration" />
  <figcaption align="center"><i> Pre - Filter available values - Configuration</i></figcaption>
</figure>

This option is used to limit the available values in a filter based on a pre-defined condition. In this example, we will
apply a pre-filter to the `electricity_usage` filter, restricting the available values based on the selection of
`department_type`.

The idea is to allow users to only see electricity usage data for specific departments, such as Housing, Library,
Police, and City Clerk, as defined by the pre-filter.

To start, select the `electricity_usage` filter and, in the Filter Configuration panel, check the
`Pre-Filter Available Values` option.

After doing this, a `Pre-Filter` field appears — now go ahead and select `Department` as the field, set the condition to
`IN`, and choose departments you want to include, such as Housing, Library, Police, and City Clerk. Then click `Save`.

:::info NOTE

We can add multiple `Pre-Filter(s)`, for a single filter creation. Also can write `Custom SQL` for filter configuration.

## Sort - FIlter Data

:::info NOTE

Option is available for these Filter Types: Value, Time Range, Time Column, Time Grain

:::

The `Sort Filter Values` option allows you to organize the values in a filter either in ascending or descending order.
You can also choose to sort based on a specific metric from the dataset.

To use this feature, simply check the `Sort Filter Values` option, then select whether the sorting should be in
ascending or descending order. Additionally, you have the option to sort by a metric available in the dataset.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/dhq-dashboard/working-with-data/filter-drill/sort.jpeg" alt=" Sort Filter Values - Configuration" />
  <figcaption align="center"><i> Sort Filter Values - Configuration</i></figcaption>
</figure>

## Single Value data filter

:::info NOTE Option is available for this Filter Type: Numerical Range

:::

The `Single Value` option allows you to restrict the filter to select just one value from the available range. You can
specify the type of single value to be chosen—whether it should be the minimum, exact, or maximum value within the
filter's range.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/dhq-dashboard/working-with-data/filter-drill/single-val.jpeg" alt=" Single Value - Configuration" />
  <figcaption align="center"><i> Single Value - Configuration</i></figcaption>
</figure>

To use this feature, check the `Single Value` box, and then select one of the following options:

- Minimum: Selects the lowest available value.
- Exact: Allows users to choose an exact value from the available options.
- Maximum: Selects the highest available value.

This configuration is useful when you want to enforce that only one specific value is used in the filter, ensuring
clarity and precision.

## Filter Settings

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/dhq-dashboard/working-with-data/filter-drill/filter-settings.jpeg" alt=" Different filter setting options" />
  <figcaption align="center"><i> Different filter setting options</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Here's the table with the available settings for each filter type:

| Setting                       | Value | Numerical Range | Time Range | Time Column | Time Grain |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Description                   | ✔     | ✔               | ✔          | ✔           | ✔          |
| Default values                | ✔     | ✔               | ✔          | ✔           | ✔          |
| Value required                | ✔     | ✔               | ✔          | ✔           | ✔          |
| Select first value by default | ✔     |                 |            |             |            |
| Select multiple values        | ✔     |                 |            |             |            |
| Dynamic search                | ✔     |                 |            |             |            |
| Inverse selection             | ✔     |                 |            |             |            |

#### Description

The "Description" setting allows you to add explanatory text or labels to filters, helping users understand the purpose
or function of each filter. This can enhance usability by providing context or guidance on what kind of values are
expected or what the filter will accomplish.

#### Filter has Default Value(s)

The `Filter has default value` setting enables you to pre-select a default value for a filter when it is first applied.
This is useful when you want certain values to be automatically chosen by the filter, saving users from having to
manually select them. For example, if you have a filter for `Department Type` and set `Human Services` as a default
value, users will see `Human Services` selected by default when they first interact with the filter.

#### Filter Value is Required

When the `Filter value is required` option is enabled, users must specify a value for the filter before they can apply
it. This setting helps prevent incomplete queries and ensures that users provide necessary input, which can improve the
accuracy and performance of data retrieval. It’s particularly useful for avoiding large or unintended queries that might
result from missing filter criteria.

#### Select First Filter Value by Default

The `Select first filter value by default` option automatically chooses the first item in a column’s data as the default
filter value. This setting is useful when you want to ensure that a default value is always selected without manual
intervention. For example, if the first item in your `Department Type` filter is `Arts,` enabling this option will
pre-select `Arts` by default, simplifying the user experience.

:::info NOTE

The `Select first filter value by default` setting helps avoid accidentally triggering expensive queries on your
dashboard.

For instance, if you’re managing a dataset of flight schedules that are frequently updated, this setting will
automatically select the first available flight option. This prevents you from running new queries every time the data
changes, saving time and resources.

:::

#### Can Select Multiple Values

The `Can select multiple values` setting allows users to choose more than one value from the filter. This option is
beneficial when you want to offer flexibility in filtering, enabling users to select several criteria at once. For
example, in a `Tags` filter, enabling this setting would allow users to select multiple tags, such as `Technology` and
`Innovation,` simultaneously.

#### Dynamically Search All Filter Values

:::caution 
Please be aware that using this option may add stress to your database. 
:::

The `Dynamically search all filter values` option enables real-time searching within the filter values as users type.
This feature is particularly useful for large datasets with many values, making it easier for users to find and select
the values they need. For example, if you have a filter with hundreds of categories, enabling this setting will allow
users to quickly locate the desired category by typing part of its name.

#### Inverse Selection

The `Inverse Selection` setting allows you to exclude specific values from the filter results. Instead of including
certain values, this option lets you filter out the selected ones, showing all other values. For instance, if you select
`Arts` and `Convection` genres with inverse selection enabled, the filter will display all genres except these two. This
can be useful for scenarios where excluding a few items is more practical than selecting many.
