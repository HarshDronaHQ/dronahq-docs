# SCIM user provisioning

SCIM, also known as System for Cross-domain Identity Management, represents the established industry standard for automating the provisioning of user accounts. This powerful protocol proves particularly valuable in scenarios where organizations rely on third-party Single Sign-On (SSO) providers such as Okta or Azure Active Directory for managing employee authentication. By leveraging SCIM, the seamless creation, updating, and deactivation of user accounts can be effortlessly synchronized across various applications, including the robust capabilities offered by DronaHQ. Consequently, companies utilizing DronaHQ alongside their preferred SSO provider can ensure efficient and automated user management processes, resulting in enhanced security and streamlined operations.
