# Deploy on Amazon EC2

Spin up a new EC2 instance. If using AWS, use the following steps:

1. On AWS EC2 dashboard, Click **Launch Instance**.
1. Click **Select** for an Ubuntu instance with version `20.04` or higher.
1. Select an instance type of at least `t3.medium` and click **Next**.
1. Ensure you select the same VPC that also includes the Databases & APIâ€™s that you will want to connect to and click **Next**.
1. Increase the storage size to `60` GB or higher and click **Next**.
1. Optionally add some Tags (e.g. `app = dronahq`) and click **Next**. This makes it easier to find if you have a lot of instances.
1. Set the network security groups for ports `80`, `443`, `22` and `8080`, with sources set to `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0`, and click **Review and Launch**. We need to open ports `80` (http) and `443` (https) so you can connect to the server from a browser, as well as port `22` (ssh) so that you can ssh into the instance to configure it and run DronaHQ. By default on a vanilla EC2, DronaHQ will run on port `8080`.
1. On the **Review Instance Launch** screen, click **Launch** to start your instance.
1. If you're connecting to internal databases, whitelist the VPS's IP address in your database.
1. From your command line tool, SSH into your EC2 instance.
1. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/dronahq/self-hosted.git`.
1. Run the command `cd self-hosted` to enter the cloned repository's directory.
1. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file using VIM (or other text editor) to set the version of DronaHQ you want to install. To do this, replace `X.Y.Z` in `image:dronahq/self-hosted:X.Y.Z` with your desired version. See [Select a DronaHQ version number](#select-a-dronahq-version-number) to help you choose a version.
1. Run `./install_sh.sh` to install  Docker and Docker Compose.
1. In your `.env` (this file is only created after running `./install_sh.sh`) add the following:

   ```docker
   # License key granted to you by DronaHQ
   LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEYs
   ```

1. Run `sudo docker-compose up -d` to start the DronaHQ server.
1. Run `sudo docker-compose ps` to make sure all the containers are up and running.
1. Navigate to your server's IP address in a web browser. DronaHQ should now be running on port `8080`.
1. Click Activate, since we're starting from a clean slate. The first user to create an account on an instance becomes the administrator.
