## Uploading Files and Folders

The File Storage interface offers various options for uploading files and folders:

- New Folder: Users can create a new folder directly within the interface. Selecting this option prompts users to enter a desired name for the folder.
- Add File(s): This option allows users to upload individual or multiple files simultaneously. Selecting this option opens a pop-up window where users can browse and select files from their local systems.
- Add Folder: Similar to uploading files, users can also upload entire folders. Selecting this option opens a pop-up window where users can choose the desired folder from their local systems.
