The DronaHQ Studio offers a control called `Markdown Editor`, which enables the composition of formatted lightweight text. Markdown is a straightforward syntax used to format text as headers, lists, boldface, and more.

With the Markdown Editor, you can easily write markdown syntax and preview the output if desired. The control generates a markdown string as its output, allowing you to incorporate formatted text into your application.

# Add to action on Markdown Editor

**value_change :**

The `value_change` event occurs when there is a modification in the Markdown Editor control. This event triggers subsequent actions, following the same action flow as other controls such as action buttons and list controls. You can utilize both on-screen and server-side actions to respond to this event.

To control the frequency or speed of the change event, you can utilize the `debounce` property associated with the control. Adjusting the debounce property allows you to manage the delay between consecutive value changes, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness.

## Markdown Editor - Control features

To view the full feature of the control, we have to view it in preview mode. There are list of properties and tools available in the control itself.
