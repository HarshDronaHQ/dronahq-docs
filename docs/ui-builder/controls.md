# Controls

Controls are the fundamental building blocks of DronaHQ apps. They serve as prebuilt interface elements that allow you to display data and enable user interactions and manipulations. You can explore the <VersionedLink to="/category/controls/">DronaHQ Controls - Reference </VersionedLink> to discover a wide range of available controls and access reference documentation for each control. These controls empower
you to create dynamic and interactive experiences within your DronaHQ apps.
