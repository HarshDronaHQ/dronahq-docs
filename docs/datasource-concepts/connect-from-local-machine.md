# Connect Datasource on Local Machine

DronaHQ allows you to connect to a database on your localhost from DronaHQ's self-hosted as well as cloud instance.

## From DronaHQ self-hosted

## From DronaHQ cloud
To connect a database on loacalhost on DronaHQ's cloud instance user will have to make use of SSH tunneling.

Please refer SSH tunneling article [here](ssh-tunneling.md).
While configuring connector you can pass host as `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` along with rest of the fields in order to connect to local database.
