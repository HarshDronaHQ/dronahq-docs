The reCAPTCHA control is an advanced mechanism used to safeguard websites from fraudulent activities and spam by bots. It serves as a preventive measure against unauthorized access and malicious automated interactions.

For instance, integrating a reCAPTCHA control into login or registration forms ensures that the user interacting with your system is a legitimate person rather than a bot attempting to compromise or exploit the platform.

## Properties

The primary property for the reCAPTCHA control is:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Sitekey  | Sitekey represents the unique site-specific key that authorizes the integration of reCAPTCHA within your website or application. It serves as an authentication token to validate and enable reCAPTCHA functionality. |
