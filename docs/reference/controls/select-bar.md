The Select Bar control is a unique interface designed to facilitate selection from a list of items arranged in a bar format. It offers a visually appealing and user-friendly way to present a range of selectable items.

Colored container indicates selection and if deselected the color is set back to the default. For example, a Select bar control can be used to let the user select all the required services by a customer.


## Binding Data Options

The Select Bar control allows users to select one or more options from a list of choices. To populate the Select Bar control with data, you can use the Bind Data option, which accepts an array of strings in JSON format.

### Binding Options Example

For example, if you want to create a Select Bar control with a list of items such as "Home," "Work," "Gym," and "Park," you can use the Bind Data option with an array of string values:

```json
[
    "Home",
    "Work",
    "Gym",
    "Park"
]
```

### Selected Options - Data Binding

To set the default selected options in the Select Bar control, use the Bind Data - Selected Option section with an array of string value(s). For example:

```json
[
    "Work",
    "Gym"
]
```

Ensure the selected options match the values within the provided data to appear correctly in the Select Bar control.
