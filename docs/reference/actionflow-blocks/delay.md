## Introducing Delay in Your Action Flow

The `Delay` action in DronaHQ lets you introduce a time gap of a few milliseconds between two actions. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as creating pauses between actions to ensure a smoother user experience or managing specific timing requirements in your app's workflow.

### Adding a Delay

To incorporate a delay action into your action flow, follow these steps:

1. Under the `Logic Block` section, select `Delay` and click `Continue`.

2. Configure the Action Fields by specifying the `Duration in Milliseconds` for the delay and click `Next`.

3. Provide a meaningful and descriptive `Action Unique Name` to identify this delay action in your flow.

4. Click `Finish` to complete the setup.

### Practical Use Cases

Now, when you add another action after the delay, there will be a short pause before the subsequent action executes. This allows you to fine-tune the timing of your app's actions and interactions.

### Precision Timing

The `Delay` action provides precision timing control, ensuring that your app functions smoothly and responsively. It's a versatile tool for enhancing user experiences and managing the flow of your application's actions.

Whether you're creating a seamless animation sequence or carefully orchestrating a series of user prompts, the `Delay` action gives you the flexibility you need.
