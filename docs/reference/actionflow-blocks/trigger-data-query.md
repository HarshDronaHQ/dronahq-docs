### Understanding the TriggerDataQuery Action
With this action, you can pass specific parameters and trigger queries based on user interactions or other control actions. This feature is essential for creating responsive workflows, where user input or certain conditions initiate real-time data queries.

### Using the TriggerDataQuery Action
1. Choose the relevant query that you wish to trigger from your data source.
2. Define any specific parameters that should be passed to the query based on user inputs or predefined conditions.
3. Use the dropdown to link the data query and adjust advanced settings as needed.
