Apache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of
data across many commodity servers while providing high availability and fault tolerance.

## Prerequisites

1. Cassandra Authentication: Before utilizing the Cassandra connector provided by DronaHQ, ensure you have valid
   authentication credentials for your Cassandra instance. You'll need:

   - Username and password associated with your Cassandra account.

2. Connection Details:

   - Identify the Datacenter: Determine the specific Cassandra datacenter you want to connect to.
   - Specify the Keyspace: Know the keyspace (similar to a database) within the Cassandra datacenter where you intend to
     perform operations.

3. Cluster Nodes: Understand the nodes in your Cassandra cluster that you will be connecting to. The connector requires
   at least one node's hostname or IP address.

## Configuring Connector in DronaHQ

Configure your database category using the provided details. Validate connection with `Test connection` and `Save`
settings for secure database setup.

## Adding Database Queries

After configuring the connector, access it in your Connector Library.

Click `Add query` once the connection is established. Create queries, run them, and view responses.

:::tip Use double curly brackets for dynamic variables. Test with sample values before saving. Link dynamic variables to
controls/actions for runtime use. :::

Saved queries appear under your connector in Connector Library.

## Supported Query Operations

| Operations            | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raw SQL Query         | Execute various SQL operations directly, e.g., `SELECT * FROM TableName;`                                       |
| Stored Procedure Call | Call stored procedures, e.g., `EXEC usp_GetInfo;` to perform specific tasks or retrieve data from the database. |

## Using Cassandra Connector

### Read/Display Data Query

Start by constructing a CQL query to extract data from your Cassandra database using the Cassandra Connector. Consider a
scenario where you want to retrieve all data from the `student` table. The CQL query is:

Query used:

```cql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

Query explanation:

This CQL query retrieves all rows and columns from the `student` table within the Cassandra database.

Integrate the fetched data into your application's interface.

a. Access the Controls section and introduce the Table grid control.

b. Navigate to `Data Bind Options -> Quick Select -> Database Queries`.

c. Opt for the Cassandra connector and choose the query that aligns with your data presentation goals.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly retrieve and display data from the `student` table using the Cassandra
Connector, enhancing your application's functionality and user experience with Cassandra data.
