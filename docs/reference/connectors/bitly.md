Bitly is a well-known URL shortener and link management platform and the DronaHQ is providing users to experience and
implement the features of the Bitly platform in their micro apps with the help of Bitly Connector. You can now get
groups and create shortened URLs.

## Configuring API Connector in DronaHQ

A pop-up will display asking you to connect to your Bitly account. Authorize it and your Bitly connector will be ready

After successfully configuring and saving the connector settings, you can easily access your newly connected account by
navigating to the `connected accounts` list. You can find this option from the `Connector -> Manage Account` section.
This centralized location allows you to conveniently monitor and manage your connected accounts.

## Supported API endpoints

| Action            | Description                                                     |

## Using Bitly Connector

### Create shortened URL

The main purpose of using the Bitly connector service is to create short URLs of long URLs. To do this we have a
dedicated endpoint called GenerateShortLink.

1. We have a microapp with several controls.

</figure>
2. On the trigger event of the button, we will add a `Connector > Library` action of Bitly connector with
   `GenerateShortLink` endpoint then select the configured account.
3. Provide the necessary details like keywords for `long URLs` and `group GUID`.

4. Test and Save, to use the response by the action's unique name.
5. Add another event to set the received output from the connector to JSON viewer.
6. Preview the app and you will get your shortened URL of a long URL.

### Get group(s) details

You can view the details like â€“ account creation date, GUID, organization name, and more - of the user account(s)
present in the ID, we have to go to the data-bind section of our control and select the Bitly connector, select
`GetGroups` endpoint, and finally select our configured account.

Do a refresh response, then bind the keys as columns for the control and click `Test & Finish`.
