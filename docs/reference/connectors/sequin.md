Sequin is a powerful tool that enables you to harness the capabilities of SQL to seamlessly connect to external APIs. With Sequin, you can build on top of third-party services like Salesforce or Airtable using SQL queries, providing a fast and efficient alternative to direct API usage.


## Configuring Sequin Sync

### Prerequisites

Before you can use Sequin with DronaHQ, follow these steps to create a Sequin sync to your Postgres database:

1. Sign Up for Sequin:
   - Start by signing up for Sequin [here](https://app.sequin.io).

2. Connect to the API:
   - Once you've signed up, connect Sequin to the API you want to sync. This is the external API you'll be working with.

3. Configure Schema:
   - Configure your schema by selecting the specific tables and columns you want to sync from the API.

4. Database Connection:
   - Sequin will prompt you to connect to your Postgres database. You can also opt to use a free demo Postgres instance hosted by Sequin.

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Connection details</i></figcaption>
</figure>

5. Initiate Sync:
   - Click `Create` to initiate the synchronization process. Sequin will start syncing your data in real-time.

6. Connection Instructions:
   - Sequin will provide you with connection instructions for your Postgres database. Keep this information accessible, as you'll need it to configure DronaHQ.

For more detailed guidance on setting up a Sequin sync, refer to this [guide](https://docs.sequin.io/getting-started#create-a-sync).




### Connector Connector in DronaHQ


Sequin uses a [Postgres Proxy](https://docs.sequin.io/writes#configuration) to interface with your Sequin-synced tables. The Proxy lets Sequin capture inserts, updates, and deletes you make in your database and commit them to the API.

To add Sequin's Postgres Proxy as a DronaHQ connector, you can treat it as a regular Postgres resource and enter the connection details in the connector configuration:


1. Access your DronaHQ dashboard and navigate to the `Connectors` section.

2. Click `+ Add Connector` and select `PostgreSQL Connector.`

3. Provide a name for the connector and paste the connection string from your Sequin dashboard.

4. Under `Connection Options,` enable `Enable converting queries to prepared statements` and `Connect using SSL` for efficient and secure database access.

5. Test the connection to ensure it's working correctly, then click `Save.`

:::tip
DronaHQ can Auto fill crucial connection values like host, name, password, and more from the connector's [connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) or from a AWS IAM credentials using [AWS Import](/datasource-concepts/aws-import).

## Adding Database Queries
After configuring the connector, access it in your Connector Library. 
To add queries, click `Add query` once the connection is ready. Create simple or complex queries, view tables and fields. Input Query name, run the query, and see results in Response.

:::tip
Use double curly brackets for dynamic variables. Test with sample values before saving. Link dynamic variables to controls/actions and more for runtime use.

Saved queries appear under your connector in Connector Library.

## Supported Query Operations

| Operations   | Description    |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Raw SQL Query | Various `select, insert, delete, update, join` operations which are supported by PostgresSQL query. e.g. - `select * from UserInfo;` |
| Stored Procedure Call | You can call store procedure similar to that we call from workbench. e.g. - `CALL getUserInfo;` |


## Using the Sequin Connector in DronaHQ

With Sequin syncing your API data to your database, you can now query this data within your DronaHQ app. Here's how to do it:

1. From your DronaHQ dashboard, access your app.

2. In the left rail, click on `Data Queries` (the database icon), then click `+ New` and select `Connector Query.`

3. Choose the Sequin Postgres Proxy connection as the connector.

4. Compose your SQL query using the schema for your Sequin-synced tables available on the right rail.

5. Click `Test` to ensure your query runs as expected.

Here's an example Salesforce query that retrieves Salesforce Contacts belonging to a specific account:

```sql
select * from salesforce.contact
-- use a query variable, {{account_id}}
where account_id = '{{account_id}}'
limit 100;
```



### Writing Back to the API

Sequin allows you to perform [mutations](https://docs.sequin.io/writes) via your database, which are then applied to the external API. In DronaHQ, you can use custom-built or auto-generated forms to insert or update data in your Sequin-synced tables.

1. Create a form with input fields matching your Sequin-synced table columns.

2. Connect the `Submit` button of your form to a database mutation query in DronaHQ.

3. Configure the insert query by populating `values` with input field values from your form.

```sql
insert into salesforce.contact (first_name, last_name, email)
values ('{{first_name}}', '{{last_name}}', '{{email}}');
```

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Inserting Contact</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Error Handling

In case Sequin encounters an error while applying a mutation to the upstream API, it returns a standard Postgres error. You can configure your app to display this error as an alert notification.

1. In the event of an error, configure an `On-Screen Action` (e.g., Toast) to display the error message.

With Sequin, you can seamlessly integrate third-party services into your DronaHQ app using SQL, making data management and utilization efficient and straightforward.
