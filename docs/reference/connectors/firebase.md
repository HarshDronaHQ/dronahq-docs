Firebase is a highly durable database that can scale automatically to handle your applicationâ€™s load. This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to configure and use Firebase services, including Firebase Auth (User Management), Firebase Realtime Database, and Firestore, using DronaHQ.



## Prerequisite

1. Firebase Configuration Details: Obtain the necessary configuration details from the Firebase console. Navigate to
   your Project settings and select the Service accounts tab. Click on the Firebase Admin SDK icon, and generate a new
   private key. This action will result in the download of a JSON file. Extract the Private key from the downloaded JSON
   file, as you will need it for configuring the Firebase Connector.

    </figure>

2. Optionally, Google Cloud Platform Account Key: If preferred, you can create an account key from your Google Cloud
   Platform (GCP) console. Follow these steps:
   1. Select a project in your GCP console.
   2. Click on "Create Service Account" and assign the role of "Firebase Admin."
   3. Opt for a JSON Key type and proceed to download the generated file. Ensure to keep this file accessible, as it
      will be required for configuring the connector.

## Configuring Connector in DronaHQ

Configure your database category using the provided details. Validate connection with `Test connection` and `Save`
settings for secure database setup.

## Adding Queries for Firebase 

Upon successful configuration of the Firebase connector, you gain the ability to handle
user-related operations, and you can adeptly manage data-related operations.


1. Define Query Name: Provide a unique name for your data management query. This name will serve as an identifier in your Connector Library for easy access and management.

2. Service: Select from the dropdown of list of services provided by the configured Firebase connector. The services available are: `firestore`, `firebase auth` and `firebase real time db`.

  <figure>
       <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/connectors/firebase-all/firebase-service.jpeg" alt="Firebase Auth" />
       <figcaption align = "center"><i>Firebase Auth</i></figcaption>
 </figure>

3. Action : Select the action you want to perform with respect to the selected service. Depending on the selected service, various actions are available to opt from while adding a query.


| Action                   | Description                                                                        |

4. Set Additional Parameters: Depending on your specific requirements, utilize optional parameters to refine the
   performing query. Customize the query by implementing filters, sorting criteria, or other pertinent options.

5. Test and Execute: Prior to finalizing, conduct a test run to verify the query's functionality. Ensure that the
    data appears correctly within the designated service in your Firebase connector.

:::tip 
Use double curly brackets for dynamic variables. Test with sample values before saving. Link dynamic variables to
controls/actions and more for runtime use. 
:::

Saved queries appear under your connector in Connector Library.


:::caution

You cannot edit the `service` of a query, once the query is already tested and added.

## Using Firebase Connector

### Service - Firestore

#### Insert Document

1. Access Data Management Section or Control Action:

   - Begin by navigating to the data management section or the control action where you want to interact with your
     Firestore database.

2. Select Firebase Firestore Connector:

   - Choose the Firebase Firestore Connector from your available options.
   - Opt for the "Insert Document" action to add new data to your Firestore collection.
   - Provide a Document ID if desired; otherwise, leave it blank for auto-generation.
   - Ensure that the data is in valid JSON format.

      <img src="/img/reference/connectors/firebase-all/fire-store-add-data.jpeg" alt="Firestore Insert Document action" />
      <figcaption align="center"><i>Firestore Insert Document action</i></figcaption>
    </figure>

3. Configuration for Data Input:

   - Configure the action by providing the necessary data in a valid JSON format.
   - This could involve collecting data from a form submission and adding it using the action.

    <figure>
      <img src="/img/reference/connectors/firebase-all/fire-store-form-example.jpeg" alt="Firestore Form Example" />
      <figcaption align="center"><i>Firestore Form Example</i></figcaption>
    </figure>

4. Execute the Action Flow:

   - Configure the Connector within the Action Flow or Server Side actions.
   - Link the action to a button click or relevant trigger.
   - When the form is submitted, the action flow triggers the Connector to save data to your Firestore collection.

5. Confirmation and Display:
   - After the action is executed, use popup or toast actions to display relevant information, such as the created
     document ID.
   - You can also display the added data in a table grid or any other appropriate visualization.

<figure>
      <img src="/img/reference/connectors/firebase-all/result.jpeg" alt="Firestore Form Example" />
</figure>

### Service - Firebase Auth (User Management)

#### Get User By Provider UID

1. Access Data Bind Section or Control Action:

   - Navigate to the data bind section of the control.

2. Select Firebase Auth (User Management) Connector from `Data Bind Options -> Quick Select -> User Queries`:
   - Choose Firebase Auth (User Management) Connector from the available options.
   - Opt for the "Get User By Provider UID" query to retrieve user details using the provider UID.
   - Click on "Continue" to proceed.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/connectors/firebase-all/get-user-provider-uid.png" alt="Get User By Provider UID query" />
  <figcaption align="center"><i>Get User By Provider UID query</i></figcaption>
</figure>

3. Test and Finalize:
   - Execute the query by testing it with dynamic values for the provider UID.
   - Upon successful testing, finalize the configuration.

By adhering to these steps, you can seamlessly harness the capabilities of the Firebase Auth (User Management) Connector
to retrieve user details based on the provider UID. This enhances your ability to work with user data effectively within
your application, providing an optimized user management experience.

#### Update a User

The `Update a User` action provides a method to modify attributes of an established Firebase Authentication user. This
action requires the user's UID (unique identifier) along with an object containing the desired profile information or
user properties to update within the user account's data.

When updating user details by referencing their UID, you can dynamically provide all values, enabling users to
conveniently pass the necessary details as parameters to the connector.

In the example below, we demonstrate updating the email address of a user through their UID.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/connectors/firebase-all/update-email.png" alt="Updating a user's email address" />
  <figcaption align="center"><i>Updating a user's email address</i></figcaption>
</figure>

To provide details to make the call, you can use various input controls and actions. Later with controls you can
showcase the end result of data after changes.

We'll be using input field to get the UID and emails to pass it as keyword parameters and display the final response in
JSON viewer.

### Service - Firebase Realtime Database

#### Appending Data to a List

To append data to a list within the Firebase Realtime Database using the Firebase Realtime Database Connector, follow
these steps:

1. Access Data Bind Section or Control Action:

   - Navigate to the data bind section of the control.

2. Select Firebase Realtime Database Connector from `Data Bind Options -> Quick Select -> Data Queries`:
   - Choose Firebase Realtime Database Connector from the available options.
   - Select the "Append data to a list" action to add new data to an existing list.
   - Click on "Continue" to proceed.

       <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/connectors/firebase-all/append.jpeg" alt="Firebase Realtime Database with append query." />
       <figcaption align = "center"><i>Firebase Realtime Database with append query.</i></figcaption>
 </figure>

3. Configure Data Input:

   - Specify the Database Ref, which is the reference to the existing list where you want to append data.
   - Provide the values to append as dynamic values. This can include any type of data, arrays, or objects.

4. Integrate with Controls and Actions:
   - Integrate this query into your workflow by adding controls like a TextInput field for user input.
   - Create an action flow that triggers the Connector action to append data.
   - Configure the connector to pass the value from the TextInput control as input.
