In application development, various user interactions trigger events that can be harnessed to perform specific actions
or functions. Let's explore the range of events available in DronaHQ, designed to enhance user interactivity and
streamline application behavior.

You have been using the input controls like the Text control, the numeric control, currency as well as the selection
controls like drop-down control, checkbox control, radio control, and so on. We have seen how to bind data using
different data sources. Now at times, you have wanted to add actions that should be performed on the happening of an
event like once you select or change the selection from a dropdown or radio control, you may want some action to be
performed. Similarly when a control loses focus, then you may want to trigger some action. For this reason, we have
a set of action events added to the different types of controls, screens and apps.

These events provide developers with granular control over application behavior, allowing for the creation of dynamic
and responsive user experiences. By leveraging these events in conjunction with DronaHQ's intuitive development
environment, developers can build powerful and interactive applications with ease.
